# Skidium Client
**NOTICE: This client is just a tiny project meant for a reborn of Radium. It's not even that good lol. Still in heavy development. Also we don't talk about why the speeds are like that.**

This is so bad rn. Lol.

## How to run
No released yet. It's barley in early alpha. ðŸ˜­

The resulting `skidium` folder is a gradle project that can opened with your favorite IDE i.e. IntelliJ.
